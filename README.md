# Advent of Code Solutions

My [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions written in Python.

All solutions have been carefully engineered to be _good enough_. Yes, even any `O(n!)` stuff you happen to find!

## Quickstart

* `python -m venv .venv`
* `source .venv/bin/activate`
* `pip install poetry`
* `poetry install`
* `pre-commit install`

Verify the installation by running `aoc --help`

Before proceeding further, log on to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) in your browser, grab the `session` cookie value, and save `session=cookievalue` in a file called `.cookie` at the project root.

## Usage

Run `aoc YEAR:DAY.PUZZLE` (e.g. `aoc 2020.2.1`)

See `aoc --help` for more options .
